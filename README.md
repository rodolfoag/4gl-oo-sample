=============

Tiny example of how to use OO in Progress 4GL.

Keep in mind those requirements in order to either run this example or create your own Classes and use them:

- Class definitions must reside in a .cls file;
- Class name must match the .cls file name, e.g.: Class Person must be in the Person.cls file;
- A path to the .cls directory must be in the PROPATH, in order to ABL be able to find the class definition at compile time;
